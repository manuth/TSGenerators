## Usage

You can install `TSGeneratorGenerator` using the following command:

```

### Generate a Generator Written in TypeScript

You can create a generator written in TypeScript using this command:

```bash
yo ts-generator
```

It is recommended to use an intelligent code-editor which is meant to be used with TypeScript (like, for example VSCode or Atom).  
Please make sure to tick the `Example Generator`-box to generate a nice example for you to see the best practices for authoring generators.

  You may want to create some generator-examples.  
  These will help you to learn more about the capabilities of the object-oriented implementation of the Yeoman-Generator.
